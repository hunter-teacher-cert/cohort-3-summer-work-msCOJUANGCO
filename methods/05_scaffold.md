### Technique: Skeleton Code

#### Well-suited to...
* Getting students started quickly
* Maximizes class time to focus on thinking through algorithms rather than java minutia
* Allows students to get a sense of the overarching algorithm (findSmallestIndex followed by sort)
* Ensures that necessary packages are imported
* Makes things easier to grade because student work has a common structure
* Provides students the opportunity to compare their ideas with their peers
* Providing essential components (e.g. method signatures) for multi-part assignments
* Building in supports via comments (may be used to subdivide algorithms)
* Supports use of tiered assignments by offering more or fewer comments based on difficulty
* serve as a clear self assessment tool mid-unit

#### Example
* SortSearch
* ArrayPractice

### Technique: Setting up the driver with specific tests

#### Well-suited to...
* Just starting to build and write methods
* Focusing students on writing the methods rather than being overwhelmed with also writing tests
* Build better habits (Test early and often, test edge cases, etc.)
* Can ensure that students test edge cases that are likely to detect errors
* May not provide the tests for more intermediate/advanced tiered tasks so that more advanced groups can build tests themselves
* Provides students the opportunity to compare their ideas with their peers

#### Example
* SortSearch and SortSearchDriver
* name of a not-necessarily coding activity
* Example:
```
  // Uncomment these to test part 2

	// int i;
	// i = ss.findSmallestIndex(0);
	// System.out.println("ss["+ i +"] = "+ss.get(i)+" : " + ss);

	// i = ss.findSmallestIndex(3);
	// System.out.println("ss["+ i + "] = "+ss.get(i)+" : " + ss);
	
	// Uncomment these to test part 3

	// System.out.println(ss);
	// ss.sort();
	// System.out.println(ss);
```
#### Bonus Info
* Unit testing is a technique that is commonly-used by real-world tech companies when writing code. When students use tests they are following practices used by professionals!

### Technique: Multiple Starter Files with Different Levels of Scaffolding

#### Well-suited to...
* Differentiating among students with different levels especially if there is just one teacher and many students
* Avoids "spoilers" for advanced students
  

#### Example
* CGOL and the advanced CGOL (with animation)

#### Bonus Info
* Allows students to self-select difficulty level and adjust if they overreach and need more support
* Teacher may choose to suggest that an undecided student try the harder version first, then scale back if needed
