### Club|Initiative: STEAM Club+Community Service

#### How It Works

1. students learn CS skills and concepts as they complete performance tasks in their CS courses
2.  the afterschool STEAM club is introduced; students join or are recruited to participate, but it is open to everyone. here, they delve deeper into or introduce each other to a CS-related topic or skill through collaborative passion projects
3.  they are then encouraged and supported to practice design thinking --a foundational piece of our school's mission-- by speaking to staff members and classmates to identify a way to support community spaces/groups/members by implementing their skills  


VALUES TO CULTIVATE
* design thinking
* collaboration (w/ staff, students, peers on other CTE pathway, industry partners, local community groups, etc.)
* resourcefullness
* community engagement
* communication skills
* student leadership (self-advocacy/facilitation/documentation/team dynamics/etc.)


#### Expected Positive Outcomes
This is attractive because...
* students will develop skills more
* have another opportunity to see and think for themselves how what they learn in the classroom can be meaningful outside of the classroom walls and the gradecook
* builds confidence, pride, and community
* conducive to career exploration and identity/goal developemt
* more opportunity to build stronger and more meaningful relationships (and not just limited to student-student nor student-teacher)
